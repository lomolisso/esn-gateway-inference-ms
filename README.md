# esn-predictive-node
This repository contains the implementation of a predictive node, allowing both cloud and gateway layers of the Edge Sensor Network (ESN) to obtain predictions based on the data collected by the sensors. The node is able to use both Keras+Tensorflow and Tensorflow Lite depending on the hardware capabilities of the device.
